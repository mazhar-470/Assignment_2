Agile approach to software development focuses on delivering value early and reduce overhead. In a traditional development approach, there 
are three major stages. Planning, Building and Testing. To develop a software in traditional or waterfall method, first careful planning 
needs to be done. After all the planning is finished, building phase starts which strictly follows the planning done in the first phase.
After building comes testing. But what if the requirements change or new requirements are added? In that case the previous plan will not 
work. As a result, the development process needs to start over again from the very beginning. Agile approach addresses this issue. Agile 
approach also has three major stages similar to the traditional approach. But agile approach goes over these stages several times. Each 
iteration delivers some level of value which means each iteration delivers a new working version of the software. Each iteration addresses 
different requirements that needs to be added to the software. As a result, even if there is a change in the requirement, agile method can
quickly address this and deliver value.
